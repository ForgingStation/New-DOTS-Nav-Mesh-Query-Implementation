# New-DOTS-Nav-Mesh-Query-Implementation
New &amp; Impreoved DOTS based Navmesh query - navigation. Learn more here - https://youtu.be/ZgTFAusOoQ4
This was long due, but I had to try out new ways to achieve a more efficient and maintainable DOTS-based navigation system that can be easily added to any entity to provide navigation capability.
I am open to feedback on the way this has now been implemented, but I have verified it to be efficient and serves the purpose of processing a set number of entities per frame without too much of an overhead.
I also have a working IJobEntity Batch version of the core navigation system that is available on GIT for you guys to have a look at.
